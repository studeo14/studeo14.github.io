I am a Computer Engineer currently working on solving hardware assurance problems at [Graf Research](https://grafresearch.com). The projects I work on range from creating custom EDA tools in C++, full stack development of web-based tools in Java/JS, internal tooling work in Python, and FPGA design work across the four major vendors (including use of the open-source [F4FPGA](https://symbiflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tools).

Outside of work I take [pic](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2565947850170977&type=3)[tures](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3571782129587539&type=3) with my [Canon AE-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_AE-1), enjoy reading a good Sci-Fi book, and try to work on some hobby projects to keep things fresh.
